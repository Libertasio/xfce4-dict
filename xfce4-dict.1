.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
xfce4-dict allows you to search different kinds of dictionary services
for words or phrases and shows you the result.
Currently you can query a "Dict" server(RFC 2229), any online dictionary
service by opening a web browser or search for words using a spell check
program like aspell, ispell or enchant.

.SH "OPTIONS"
If called without any arguments, the xfce4-dict main window is shown.
Any passed text argument(s) are used as search text.

.IP "\fB-w\fP, \fB\-\-web\fP         " 10
Search the given text using a web-based search engine.
.IP "\fB-t\fP, \fB\-\-text-field\fP         " 10

.IP "\fB-s\fP, \fB\-\-spell\fP         " 10

.IP "\fB-i\fP, \fB\-\-ignore-plugin\fP         " 10

.IP "\fB-c\fP, \fB\-\-clipboard\fP         " 10

a search. This is useful when you want to create keyboard shortcuts for this command.

default search method is used.
If the PRIMARY clipboard doesn't contain any text, the normal clipboard is used.
.IP "\fB-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP         " 10

.IP "\fB-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP         " 10

xfce4-dict supports all generic GTK options, a list is available on the help screen.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
There is a limitation of max. 12 characters in passing a search term
to xfce4\-dict when the panel plugin is loaded. That is, if you pass a search
term as command line argument(s) to xfce4\-dict which is longer than 12
characters, it is truncated. To be exact, the limit is 12 bytes so if
the search term contains any non\-ASCII characters it might be even less
than 12 characters.
To work around this limitation, you can add the command line '\-i' so
that xfce4-dict will start a single stand\-alone application. Then all
passed text is used as search term.
